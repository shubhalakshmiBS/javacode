Unit Test Case:
1. Test for correct sum calculation:
    - Input: myArray = {1, 5, 10, 25}
    - Expected Output: 41

2. Test for empty array:
    - Input: myArray = {}
    - Expected Output: 0

3. Test for negative numbers in array:
    - Input: myArray = {-1, 5, 10, -25}
    - Expected Output: -11

4. Test for large array:
    - Input: myArray = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}
    - Expected Output: 1500

5. Test for array with duplicate numbers:
    - Input: myArray = {1, 5, 5, 10, 25}
    - Expected Output: 46
