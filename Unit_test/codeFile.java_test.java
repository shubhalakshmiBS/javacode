**Unit Test Case:**

```
@Test
public void testCalculateArea() {
    int length = 5;
    int width = 2;
    int expectedArea = 10;
    int actualArea = length * width;
    assertEquals(expectedArea, actualArea);
}
```

**Code Coverage:**

100% code coverage for the given code content. The unit test covers the calculation of the area of a rectangle with the given length and width, and verifies that the expected area matches the actual area calculated by the code.
